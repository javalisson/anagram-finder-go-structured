# ANAGRAM FINDER

Implement a function which takes a list of words as an argument and finds
all anagrams within the list. Anagrams are words which contain the exact 
same letters, like CREATED/CATERED/REACTED.

Create a vector for each group of 2 or more anagrams, then return the vector
of all groups. You can put the results in any order.
